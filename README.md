# Plex for WatchOS

This project exists because I love Plex Amp, but it has no Apple Watch support.

The result of this will be a WatchOS only app that links to your Plex account and allows streaming or downloading music from your Plex server directly to an Apple Watch.

It may be expanded to allow streaming anything, but for now its all about the music.
